## Overview
This project analyzes car-related data to uncover trends in vehicle performance, pricing, and fuel efficiency. Using **SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Power BI**, the analysis provides insights into factors affecting car prices, mileage, and market trends.

## Features
- **Price Analysis**: Identify factors influencing car prices, such as brand, age, and fuel type.
- **Fuel Efficiency Trends**: Compare mileage across different car models and fuel types.
- **Brand Comparisons**: Evaluate market trends for various automobile brands.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Discover relationships between engine capacity, mileage, and price.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards in **Power BI/Tableau** for data-driven insights.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes car specifications, fuel efficiency, pricing, and market trends. It is sourced from:
- Online car marketplaces (CSV files/APIs)
- Automotive industry reports
- Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (Data extraction and transformation)
- **Power BI/Tableau** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Exploratory data analysis)

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Load the dataset (`car_data.csv`).
2. Clean and preprocess data using **Python & Pandas**.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends.
4. Create SQL queries to extract insights.
5. Develop dashboards in **Power BI/Tableau** for interactive reporting.

## Results
- **Fuel-efficient cars** tend to have smaller engines and lightweight bodies.
- **Luxury brands** retain value better over time.
- **Diesel cars** generally provide better mileage but have higher maintenance costs.

## Future Enhancements
- Predictive modeling for car price estimation.
- Sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
- Integration with real-time car market data.
